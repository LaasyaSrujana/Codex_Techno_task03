# Task 3: Car Price Prediction 

This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars based on various features such as year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and more using machine learning.

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio (for deployment)

# Files Included:
- `car_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code
- `car_data.zip`: Dataset file
- `car_price_output.png`: Screenshot of the output
- `demo_video_link.txt`: Contains Google Drive link to demo video

# Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and testing
- Interactive Gradio app to predict car price based on inputs

# Video Demo:
The working Gradio model demo can be viewed (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IFCmU5A4VblAQAZ3N8A952YM5JAiDwqk/view?usp=drive_link).
